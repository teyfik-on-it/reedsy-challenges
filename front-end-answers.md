# Front end Engineer Challenge Response

## 1. About me

- I have created the entire UI of [sistemkoin.com](https://www.sistemkoin.com/) _(which is built on Angular 2+)_ with a 
limited amount of time and in an all-new environment. It was the first crypto currency exchange project that I have 
involved and so on I have earned a lot of experience while working on the project.

- I worked on [trcrm.com](http://trcrm.com/) _(which is built on angular.js)_ as a full-stack developer. In general, I 
took part in the front-end and have been responsible for creating more interactive features powered by JavaScript. 


## 2. General

##### 2.1. What kind of front end projects do you enjoy working on? Why?
- I am enjoying when I am building highly interactive real-time user interfaces due to it is complexity and dynamism. 

##### 2.2. Which are your favorite features of HTML5? How have you used them before?
HTML5 features that I love and use most;

- **Styling** helps me to make applications that look more pleasing and interesting to users.
- **Semantics** helps me to create more definitive and accessible content. 
- **Offline & Storage** helps me to make faster and more portable applications.

##### 2.3. Explain the difference between creating a DOM element setting `innerHTML` and using `createElement`.
- The main problem with using intnerHTML is often security related due to untrusted html content, followed by 
performance problems come into context. Also all the child nodes will be overwritten when modifying innerHTML so if you 
have any event listener or if you have referenced any variable to a child element you will have to register them again.  

##### 2.4. Compare two-way data binding vs one-way data flow.
- Two-way data binding saves the developer from the struggle to synchronize data between model and view. On the other 
hand, one-way data bindings are more successful due to less change detection. Although this may not be noticed by the 
end user or developer.

##### 2.5. Why is asynchronous programming important in JavaScript?
- Because each code snippet that works synchronously prevents event loop and user interaction, asynchronous programming 
gains importance when it comes to single threaded languages such as JavaScript.
